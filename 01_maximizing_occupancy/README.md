# Maximizing Occupancy

## Overview

Occupancy in CUDA refers to the ratio of active warps to the maximum number of warps supported on a multiprocessor. Maximizing occupancy is crucial for achieving high performance in CUDA kernels.

## Why It's Important

Higher occupancy can help hide memory latency and improve overall GPU utilization. However, it's important to note that maximum occupancy doesn't always equate to best performance, as other factors like shared memory usage and register pressure also play a role.

## Key Concepts

1. **Thread Block Size**: Choose a thread block size that is a multiple of 32 (warp size) for efficient execution.
2. **Grid Size**: Ensure enough blocks to keep all SMs busy.
3. **Resource Usage**: Balance shared memory and register usage to allow for higher occupancy.

## Optimization Techniques

1. Use the CUDA Occupancy Calculator to determine optimal launch configurations.
2. Experiment with different thread block sizes (e.g., 128, 256, 512 threads per block).
3. Reduce per-thread resource usage (registers, shared memory) to allow for more concurrent blocks.
4. Use `__launch_bounds__` to give the compiler hints about maximum thread block size.
