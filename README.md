# Optimization Techniques for CPU and GPU

## Overview

This repository contains examples and learning materials related to CPU and GPU optimization techniques to improve performance. While the focus will be primarily on NVIDIA GPUs, many of the principles can be applied to other hardware as well.

As I learn new techniques and concepts, I will update this repository with additional examples and explanations.
